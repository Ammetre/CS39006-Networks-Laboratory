Antony and Cleopatra tells the story of a romance between two powerful lovers: Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, and Mark Antony, 
who rules the Roman Empire with Octavius Caesar and Lepidus. Although he is needed in Rome, Antony lingers in Egypt with 
Cleopatra. He finally returns to Rome when Pompey, another military leader, tries to gain control of the empire. 
Once in Rome, Antony marries Caesar’s sister Octavia.

After Pompey is defeated, Caesar imprisons Lepidus and turns on Antony. Octavia attempts to reconcile them, but fails. 
Antony returns to Cleopatra. He challenges Caesar at sea, adding Cleopatra’s ships to his own. When she and her navy 
flee in mid-battle, Antony follows, abandoning his men.

Antony fails in a second battle at sea. At first, he blames Cleopatra and plans to kill her. He responds to false news of 
her death, however, by attempting suicide; fatally wounded, he reunites with her as he dies. Faced with Caesar’s plans to 
humiliate her in Rome, Cleopatra kills herself with poisonous snakes.
